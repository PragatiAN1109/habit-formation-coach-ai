## Template 4: Environment Design Plan

Design your physical space to make good habits easier and bad habits harder.

**For Making Habits Obvious (Cue Visibility):**
- Place habit items in plain sight
- Use visual reminders (sticky notes, phone wallpaper)
- Prepare your environment the night before

**For Making Habits Attractive:**
- Create a dedicated habit space
- Use temptation bundling (pair with something enjoyable)
- Join a community that practices the habit

**For Making Habits Easy:**
- Reduce friction — remove steps between you and the habit
- Use the 2-minute rule to start
- Prepare materials in advance

**For Making Habits Satisfying:**
- Use a habit tracker (visual progress)
- Reward yourself immediately after (small, non-contradictory rewards)
- Track streaks — never miss twice

Track consistency across a 7-day week.

```

## Template 6: Habit Scorecard

Rate your existing habits to identify what to keep, change, or eliminate.

For each habit, mark:
- `+` = Good habit (supports your goals/identity)
- `-` = Bad habit (works against your goals)
- `=` = Neutral habit (neither helps nor hurts)

**Example Scorecard:**
```
Wake up at 7am          +
Check phone immediately -
Drink water first       +
Skip breakfast          -
Commute (listen to podcast) =
